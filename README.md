🧪 A realistic justification for how APIs could be used to create such a dataset


📊 Overview
This project explores a comprehensive dataset compiled from four different global sources, unified by year and geographical location. The dataset was curated to reveal underlying patterns and signals associated with suicide rates globally. The focus is on understanding how age, gender, generation, GDP, population size, and Human Development Index (HDI) intersect with suicide prevalence in various countries across multiple decades.

The dataset contains 27,820 records and spans a diverse set of countries and socio-economic contexts from the year 1985 to 2016.

📂 Dataset Fields
country: Nation where data was recorded

year: Year of data capture

sex: Gender category

age: Age group

suicides_no: Absolute number of suicides

population: Total population of the demographic

suicides/100k pop: Suicide rate per 100,000 individuals

HDI for year: Human Development Index (sparse)

gdp_for_year ($): Country GDP

gdp_per_capita ($): GDP per individual

generation: Sociological generation (e.g., Millennials, Boomers)



💡 Problem Statements
📌 Problem Statement 1:
“Identify the key socio-economic and demographic indicators most strongly correlated with increased suicide rates among males aged 35–54 across low-HDI countries over a 30-year period.”

📌 Problem Statement 2:
“Develop a data-driven model to detect early warning signals of suicide spikes in countries undergoing rapid economic change (measured by GDP per capita growth), with a focus on young adults aged 15–24.”

🧩 Problem questions
How do suicide rates vary by generation and age group across countries with differing GDP per capita?

Is there a gender disparity in suicide rates that persists over time or within specific regions?

How strongly is GDP per capita or HDI associated with suicide rates?

Are there temporal trends (e.g., increasing or decreasing suicide rates) within a given country or globally?

Can specific age-sex-country cohorts be identified as high-risk groups based on historical data?

While the raw data is anonymized, it stems from the combined efforts of institutions like the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank, and UNDP.
